Yoo sup!
My name is Ali and im a student developer.
I started developing simple to inermediate games WITHOUT using engines like unity or UE.
I will post several random projects that are still helpful to get a understanding of certain stuff in projects and also 
help you learn the object oriented programming which is also an important milestone.
Languages that I use are mainly Python and Java but I can use C++ or C#. In Addition to that im starting learn Rust
and plan to learn to develope some games with godot in the future.

There will be definetely some projects and simple games in the future that I will share with the purpose of helping 
people find their interest in what I like to do.

Have a great day!
