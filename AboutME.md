Yoo sup!
My name is Ali. I'm a full stack developer and attend college till 2025.
I started developing simple to inermediate games WITHOUT using engines like unity or UE.
I will post several projects that are helpful to get an understanding of certain stuff, such as certain algorithms, functions etc...
I am mainly focused on OOP but I additionally have experience with other programming languages.
That Languages that I mainly use are Python, Java and JavaScript but I have basic knowledge in C++ and C#.

There will be definetely some projects and simple games in the future that I will share with the purpose of helping 
people find their interest in what I like to do.

Have a great day!
